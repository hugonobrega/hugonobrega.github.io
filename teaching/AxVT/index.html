</p>
<p>
	<b>Intended audience:</b> B.Sc. students of Mathematics, M.Sc. students of Logic.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Goal of this course:</b> Understanding of the connections between logic and set theory, in particular the axiomatic approach. Skilful handling of ordinals and cardinals, in particular the methods of transfinite induction and recursion.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Content of the course:</b> Axioms of Set Theory, Set Theory as a Foundations of Mathematics, Ordinal Numbers, Cardinal Numbers, Axiom of Choice. Possibly basics of some additional topics such as set theory of the reals, descriptive set theory, and large cardinals. 
</p>
<p>
	<b>Prerequisites:</b> Mathematical maturity, decent understanding of first-order logic.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Evaluation:</b> 
	<ol>
		<li /> <b>Homework.</b>
		<ul>
			<li /> There will be 6 or 7 homework sheets.
			
			<li /> The homework sets are to be done by each student individually.
			
			<li /> The preferred method for submitting homework solutions is by handing them in before the start of the werkcollege on Wednesday morning. 
			Electronic submissions are also possible, by email to <tt>ilin.juli (at) gmail.com</tt> or <tt>hugonobrega (at) gmail.com</tt> before the deadline. 
			These <u>must</u> be in a single, legible PDF file. 
			It is also possible to hand in your homework by putting it into Julia's or Hugo's mailboxes in the Logic department at Science Park 107, but in this case the deadline for submission is at <u>10:45am</u> on the day of the submission deadline. 
			It is important to respect the strict deadlines stated above; late homework will not be accepted. 
		</ul>
		
		<li /> <b>Exam.</b> 
		The exam will be on <i>27 May 2014, 18-21, <b>JWS zaal 2 (James Wattstraat 78)</b></i>.
		
		<li /> <b>Final grade.</b>
		The final grade for the course is composed 1/3 from the homework and 2/3 from the final exam.
	</ol>
	
	<p>
		If you do not pass the course in the first attempt, there will be a <i>hertentamen</i> on <i>2 July 2014, 13-16, <b>SP D1.110</b></i>. In those cases where it becomes necessary to redo (parts of) the homework component, we shall discuss individual solutions.
