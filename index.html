<span class="name">Hugo <span class="hidename">(de Holanda Cunha)</span> Nobrega</span>

<p>I am currently a postdoc at the <a href="https://www.cos.ufrj.br/index.php/en/" target="_blank">Systems and Computer Engineering Program</a> of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.<br />
Beginning in July 2018, I will hold a permanent position at the <a href="http://www.dcc.ufrj.br/" target="_blank">Computer Science Department</a> of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.
</p>

<p>Before this, I did a PhD at the <a href="http://www.illc.uva.nl/" target="_blank">Institute for Logic, Language and Computation</a> (ILLC) of the University of Amsterdam, where I was supervised by <a href="http://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/loewe/" target="_blank">Benedikt Löwe</a>.<br />  
	My thesis is titled "<a href="https://www.illc.uva.nl/cms/Research/Publications/Dissertations/DS-2018-09.text.pdf" target="_blank">Games for functions: Baire classes, Weihrauch degrees, transfinite computations, and ranks</a>".
	I also wrote a Master's <a href="http://www.illc.uva.nl/Research/Publications/Reports/MoL-2013-16.text.pdf" target="_blank">thesis</a> at the ILLC (also working with Benedikt Löwe).</p>

<p>Both my PhD and MSc theses at the ILLC are on the topic of infinite games that characterize classes of functions in descriptive set theory and their connections to the Weihrauch degrees from computable analysis.</p>

<p>I also hold
	<ul>
		<li /> a Master of Science degree from the <a href="http://www.cos.ufrj.br/" title="in Portuguese" target="_blank">Systems and Computer Engineering Program</a> of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, where I was advised by <a href="http://www.cos.ufrj.br/~cerioli/" title="in Portuguese" target="_blank">Márcia R. Cerioli</a> and <a href="http://www.cos.ufrj.br/~petrucio/" title="in Portuguese" target="_blank">Petrucio Viana</a> and wrote my <a href="http://objdig.ufrj.br/60/teses/coppe_m/HugoDeHolandaCunhaNobrega.pdf" title="in Portuguese" target="_blank">dissertation</a> on some general properties of characterizations of graph classes by forbidden substructures, and on the characterization by forbidden subgraphs of a certain class of intersection graphs of paths in a tree (an English short version of the text is <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/12770138/UFRJ_thesis_summary.pdf" target="_blank">available here</a>). This dissertation was selected by the <a href="http://www.sbc.org.br/en/" target="_blank">Brazilian Computer Society</a> as one of the <a href="http://www.imago.ufpr.br/csbc2012/ctd.php" title="in Portuguese" target="_blank">10 best</a> master's theses in computer science defended in Brazil in 2011; and
		
		<li /> a Bachelor of Mathematics degree from the Fluminense Federal University, Brazil.
	</ul>
</p>

<p>Don't let the exceedingly long and Brazilian-looking name scare you: I go by Hugo Nobrega in academic settings and just Hugo socially, and I'm usually pretty good at recognizing my first name in the Portuguese, English, French, German, Dutch, and other <a href="http://www.forvo.com/word/hugo" target="_blank">pronunciations</a>.</p>
